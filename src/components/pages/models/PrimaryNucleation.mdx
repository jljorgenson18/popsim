# Primary Nucleation

Primary nucleation is a mechanism based on the assumption that there is a minimum size below which 
polymers are unstable. This minimum size is known as the critical nucleus, $$n_c$$, 
and models which include primary nucleation assume that the populations $$[N_{r < n_c}]$$
are effectively $$0$$. Primary nucleation is defined by the equation
$$
n_cN_1 \iff N_{n_c}
$$
and proceeds forward with bulk rate constant $$k_n$$. If a polymer of any size $$r < n_c$$ is 
produced, by any mechanism, the polymer completely dissolves and $$r$$ monomers are produced. 
The rate at which the bulk concentration of nuclei increases due to primary nucleation is 
given by 

$$
\frac{dc_{n_c}}{dt} = k_n c_1^{n_c}.
