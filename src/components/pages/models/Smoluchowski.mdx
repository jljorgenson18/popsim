# Smoluchowski Model

The Smoluchowski model is similar to the Oosawa model, with the modification that polymers
may break and merge with each other, otherwise reffered to as dissociation (or fragmentation)
and coagulation. The model is defined by the equations
$$
[N_1] + [N_{r>n_c}] \iff [N_{r+1}]\\
[N_r] + [N_s] \iff [N_{r+s}]\\
[N_{r<n_c}] \implies n_c[N_1]\\
n_c[N_1] \iff [N_{n_c}],
$$
where $$N_r$$ represents a polymer composed of $$r$$ monomers and $$n_c$$ is
the critical nucleus size. It is assumed that polymers smaller than the critical
nucleus effectively do not exist. Monomer addition and subtraction proceed with bulk 
rate constants $$a$$ and $$b$$, merging and breaking with rate constants $$k_a$$ and $$k_b$$, and nucleation 
with rate constant $$k_n$$, respecively. If a monomer is subtracted from a critical nucleus, or one or both fragments
of a broken polymer are smaller than the crtical nucleus, it assumed the polymer immediately dissolves 
into monomers.
