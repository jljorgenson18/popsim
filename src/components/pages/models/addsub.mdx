# Monomer addition and subtraction

Monomer addition and subtraction are the most basic mechanisms by which
polymers may grow and shrink. They are governed by the equation
$$
N_1 + N_r \iff N_{r+1}.
$$
The reaction proceeds forward (addition) with bulk rate constant $$a$$ and 
backward (subtraction) with rate constant $$b$$. The rate at which the bulk 
concentration of polymers of size $$r$$ changes is given by 

$$
\frac{dc_r}{dt} = ac_1c_{r-1} - bc_{r} - ac_1c_r + bc_{r+1}.
$$
