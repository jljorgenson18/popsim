# The Oosawa Model

The Oosawa model is a model of nucleated-polymerization defined by the reactions
$$
[N_1] + [N_{r>n_c}] \iff [N_{r+1}]\\
n_c[N_1] \iff [N_{n_c}],
$$
where $$N_r$$ represents a polymer composed of $$r$$ monomers and $$n_c$$ is
the critical nucleus size. It is assumed that polymers smaller than the critical
nucleus effectively do not exist. Monomer addition and subtraction proceed with bulk 
rate constants $$a$$ and $$b$$, respectively, and nucleationoccurs with rate constant 
$$k_n$$. If a monomer is subtracted from a critical nucleus,it assumed the polymer 
immediately dissolves into $$n_c$$ monomers.
