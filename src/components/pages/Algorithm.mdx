# Gillespie Algorithm

Popsim uses an implementation of the Next Reaction form of the Gillespie Algorithm to generate
statistically accurate stochastic trajectories. It is qualitatively similar to both Kinetic
and Dynamic Monte Carlo simulations. To begin, the algorithm is given an initial state, $$\psi_0$$ at 
$$t = 0$$ and the transition rates of all $$k$$ possible reactions, $$r_i$$, are identified. Next, the 
cumulative transition rate, $$R_i$$, for each reaction is calculated:
$$
R_{i} = \sum_{j=1}^{i} r_j
$$
and the total transition rate is defined as
$$
Q = \sum_{j=1}^{k} r_j.
$$
A uniform random number, $$u\in(0,1]$$, is then generated and the next reaction is selected by finding 
the cumulative transition rate which satisifies the relation
$$
R_{i-1} < uQ \leq R_i.
$$
The state is then updated based on the selected reaction, $$\psi_0\to\psi_1$$. Lastly, a new uniform 
random number, $$u'\in(0,1]$$, is drawn and the the time is updated, $$t=t+\Delta t$$, where
$$
\Delta t = Q^{-1}ln\bigg(\frac{1}{u'}\bigg).
$$
This process is then repeated until the user-given end time is reached. A major benefit of this approach is that 
one only needs to know the possible transitions from the current state, rather than all of the possible next states.
In general many trajectories are generated, binned and averaged to produce a time series of species populations. In 
Popsim, the first two moments of the distribution, excluding the monomers, as well as their standard deviations are 
also calculated. These represent the number of polymers and the mumber of monomers contained within them.
